Boiletplate: [React-Redux-Saga Boilerplate](https://github.com/gilbarbara/react-redux-saga-boilerplate/)

### Setup and run
- npm install
- npm start

### Test
- didn't write test

### How did you decide which technologies to use as part of your solution?
- in a real project, I would have choose base on ease of use, reliability, performance and filesize
- in this case however, I used a boiletplate with sass, redux, sagas to showcase my capabilities

### Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
- I probably set the title in store instead of using a callback on init

### What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
- clean up useless files from the boiletplate
- write tests
- it is almost fully responsive, except the header nav on mobile screen, would have fix that as well
